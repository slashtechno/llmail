# LLMail  
Interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) via email.

### Features  
- Utilize any OpenAI-compatible API
- Check every _n_ seconds 
- No need for a local database - uses IMAP

## Prerequisites  
### Python  
- Python ^3.11
- Poetry <!-- (optional)  -->
- An API key from an OpenAI-compatible API
    - At the time of writing, [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models) provides free access to select models
        - Right now, they are the only provider that will work due to the model being hard-coded (for now)
